 2. After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor at a baud rate of 115200 and Press the ESP32 “Enable” button to restart the board, and copy the ESP32 IP address that shows up on the Serial Monitor.

 3. Open your browser, paste the ESP IP address, and you should see the web page you’ve created previously. To control the servo motor speech " يمين " to move motor to 180° and " يسار " to move motor the 0°, or you can move the slider.
